# Sound-Pressure-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

# Dataset

The dataset is downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise). 
The data consists of 1503 entries, each having 5 features. 
Target Sound_pressure_level as the dependent variable (to be predicted). In predictive modeling, we should always check missing values in data.
